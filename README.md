# ninjira
A Chrome & Firefox compatible extension to augment JIRA to generate formatted (commit) message for a task.

Provides customizable formatted text for a task of a story or defect in JIRA (Agile Management Tool) "Taskboard" page. This is useful for example when the code committers wish to adhere to a format in commit messages. The extension adds a (customizable) action link to each task on the taskboard, when clicked a formatted message is copied to the system clipboard.
